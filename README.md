# Drivers-Behaviour-Recognizer-and-Attention-System
# I have used state-farm dataset to train my model.
# Developed a machine learning application using python, OpenCV, Tensor flow for driver behavior monitoring.

# Built and Trained the model using CNN algorithm

# "CNN_predict_image.py" takes input as an image and predict the class of distracted driver.
# "inputvideo.py" takes input as an video and predict the class of the driver behavior on each frame.
# "predictlive.py" It invokes the camera and predict the drivers behavior in live environment.
